FpML Schema Versions
====================

How to determine which version of the FpML schemas are in use in the DealSink API:

The versions of the FpML schemas in use in the DealSink API are determined by the release of FpML in force at the time the API was released. 

For each schema-based product supported by the API, the relevant SWML mapping specification will contain the URL on the FpML website from which the relevant FpML schema files may be downloaded.
